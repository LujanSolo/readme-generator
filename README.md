## Description
  
This node.js application is a quick and easy way to generate your READme document for your next project. Rather than spending excess time designing a READme, this app will auto-generate the document for you, complete with License badges and links, and all of the appropriate sections you would expect to find on a classic READme markdown file. Spend less time designing the ancillaries and get back to work on the main code!

To use, be sure to have node.js and this app’s files downloaded to your system. In your CLI (terminal, gitbash), type ’node index.js’ and then, follow along and answer the questions in your command line interface.
